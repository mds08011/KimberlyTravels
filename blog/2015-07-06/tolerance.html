    <h2>The Highest Result of Education is Tolerance</h2>
    <h5>July 6, 2015</h5>
    <p>Today, I&#8217;ve made it past a month here.  I am 1/27th of the way through my experience here.  And I&#8217;ll probably still feel the same way in month 27, but now I am constantly surprised by this country.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes, I&#8217;m surprised by what other people are doing.  Like when women grab my boobs to ask if I&#8217;d like to help feed the baby.  Or when a kid riding a donkey chases his friends and hits them with a stick.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes, I&#8217;m surprised by the weather.  It&#8217;s the rainy season, and even though it hasn&#8217;t been as wet as it usually is (or so I&#8217;m told), you&#8217;ve probably never seen rain like this before.  The side-ways, always accompanied by booming thunder and blinding lightning, close and lock your tin door, street-flooding, activity-ending rain.  And then as quickly as it starts, it ends and it&#8217;s back to being 105 degrees and sunny and you&#8217;re left to walk to class in the six inches of water flowing down the street.</p>
   
    <p>Sometimes, I&#8217;m surprised by what I do.  I live nearly off the grid, with a phone with poor cell coverage and even more poor data coverage.  More surprising, I&#8217;m really okay with it.  I have unlimited texting and calling to the other volunteers (way to have your shit together, Peace Corps), but I&#8217;m feeling less and less of a need to be in constant contact with people.  I&#8217;m surprised at the role I&#8217;ve taken within my host family &#8211; awkward American (often mistaken for Frenchwoman) who tells women not to hit their children, gives their meat to the toddlers and insists everyone wash their hands with soap.  I&#8217;m surprised at how quickly I&#8217;ve made made friendships and how fiercely I want to maintain those relationships. Sometimes too, I&#8217;m surprised at how frustrated I am, while other times I am outright shocked that I kept my cool in a situation.</p>
    
    <p>Other times, I&#8217;m surprised at the wealth of knowledge my fellow volunteers have, their compassion, their can-do attitudes, their attentive listening skills, and how incredibly, heart-wrenchingly, delightfully nerdy they are.  These people are some of the most intelligent people I&#8217;ve ever met, and I think the following quote from Helen Keller does a pretty good job of explaining what we&#8217;re all doing here: &#8220;The highest result of education is tolerance.&#8221;</p>
