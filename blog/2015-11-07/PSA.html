    <h2>PSA</h2>
    <h5>November 2015</h5>
    <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
    <p>I appreciate each and every one of you.  I appreciate each and every minute you spend here, sharing my experience with me.</p>
    <p>Please remember that these are my own personal views, and not the view of the United States government, the Malian government, or the US Peace Corps.</p>
    <p>This means you get something really cool: an undoctored account of my life in Mali.  It also means that maybe sometimes things aren&#8217;t going to be 100% positive.  Because life in the Peace Corps isn&#8217;t always 100% positive, and certainly life in Mali isn&#8217;t always 100% positive.  With diversity, you also get poverty, illiteracy, famine, preventable childhood diseases, isolation, confusion, frustration, and so much more.  And if I leave all of those out, you&#8217;d never be able to understand what my life here is like.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
