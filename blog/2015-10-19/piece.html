    <h2>Thereâ€™s A Piece Of Me In Every Single Second Of Every Single Day</h2>
    <h5>October 19, 2015</h5>

    <p>Today, I began my community baseline survey.  This is Peace Corps speak for: go out and try to discover problems in your community by asking questions far above your language level.  It&#8217;s also a good opportunity to physically get to know the village, meet people, work on language skills and practice working with your homologue.</p>
    
    <p>I started my day like I do most days here at my site: I woke up at 5:15 to the sound of susu.  My host family pounding rice or corn into powder.  I usually fall back asleep or roll around fitfully until the sun rises or it gets too hot in my bug net.  Then I take water from the well and wash.  Today I cooked eggs and made an egg sandwich (one of the many things I&#8217;d never eat in the states, but is getting me through Mali).  Most mornings I head to the CSCom and sit around doing nothing (or watching people give vaccinations, or telling people I&#8217;m not a doctor, or that I don&#8217;t speak French), but today I reviewed my community baseline survey questions instead.</p>
    
    <p>I also spent four hours on the phone with people from the Peace Corps office, because get this: the US Ambassador to Mali is coming to my site.  It&#8217;s a logistical nightmare, my community is so excited and has a million questions, and everyone seems at least a little confused.</p>

    <p>I made a lunch of Malian PCV mac and cheese (which is more mac and cheese in theory, rather than in practice).  After I was done cooking, I came outside to talk to the kids on my compound (I gave them bubbles yesterday, so they were being needy), and I talked to a strange man in French about his desire to eat my cat (the meat is good!) and what on Earth I am doing here.</p>
   
    <p>Later my homologue came, and we went to seven different concessions and interviewed people.  My survey is kind of long: 45 questions, but everyone was incredibly patient, willing to answer the questions, and in most cases thankful for me being there.  Most people I interviewed today are from the poorer end of my village.  They&#8217;re the people who are shocked I can write (I don&#8217;t tell them I can in three languages), who don&#8217;t know which vegetables you can buy when (because they can&#8217;t afford to buy them), who tell me they wash their hands after every time they go to the bathroom (immediately after telling me they have no soap because it&#8217;s too expensive).  But they&#8217;re also people who greet me as their friend (even if I&#8217;ve never met them), offer to feed me (even if they&#8217;re struggling to feed their families), offer me a seat (even if it&#8217;s the one broken stool), and welcome me into their village and homes (even if I ask them prying questions).</p>

    <p>When I came home, I realized the strange man was back on my compound.  My host brother asked me who he was, and I said &#8220;he&#8217;s the guy who wanted to eat my cat earlier.&#8221;  My host brother yelled at him, and told him he can&#8217;t eat my cat.  Now, usually I&#8217;m not actually worried about this.  Malians don&#8217;t like cats, but they don&#8217;t usually eat them.  Unless they&#8217;re traditional healers.  Then they eat them and use their bones for spells.  Guess who this guy is?  The village traditional doctor.  Then, he used some bones (maybe another cat&#8217;s) to place a spell on me to help me understand all Bambara and speak well.  This involved him holding my hands (and squeezing surprisingly hard), chanting, asking people to say &#8220;amen&#8221; with him, and giving me a mirror as a gift.  So far, I have not noticed the effects.</p>
    
    <p>The traditional doctor ate dinner with us, probably not because anyone wanted him to, but just because he wouldn&#8217;t leave.</p>
    
    <p>This was a significantly more exciting day than most, but it was a good reminder of some really important things.  A lot of people say &#8220;as a PCV you&#8217;ll never get to sit in the shade of the trees you planted.&#8221;  While I don&#8217;t disagree (in most respects), I find this a really negative view.  I prefer to think more along the lines of the beautiful, eloquent people who make up Jack&#8217;s Mannequin: &#8220;There&#8217;s a piece of me in every single second of every single day.&#8221;  It&#8217;s enough for me to be here, and to be giving parts of myself to this country and its people.  Even if there&#8217;s no tree.  Even if the tree does exist, but is struck by lightning.  Even if I never sit under its shade.  I was here.  I&#8217;m part of this place.  Every second, of every day.</p>
